# Randomized Pivoting Strategies for the Simplex Method Project
This is the public repository for my (Goktug Saatcioglu) Spring 2019 Numerical Optimization Project. The main program to be run is test.m contained in the src directory. If you wish to recompile the tex file you may do so using make_project.sh. While running pdflatex, if you encounter any errors relating to the bibliography then just hit enter (there is a small unicode encoding issue that I have been unable to resolve). Of course, if you modify the text files then you may introduce any errors which I am not responsible for!

For any questions or suggestions please feel free to reach out to me at gs2417 at nyu dot edu.
